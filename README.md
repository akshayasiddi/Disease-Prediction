# Disease Prediction 

In this research, we examine the use of machine learning algorithms to disease prediction from symptoms.

Algorithms Examined
The coding exploration of the following methods includes

1. Decision Tree 
2. Naive Bayes 
3. Random Forest

# Dataset

The dataset/ csv files have 133 total columns, 132 of them being symptoms experienced by patients and last column in prognosis for the same.
